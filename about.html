My idol is Steve Jobs . Who called Silicon Valley the Cradle of innovation And the man himself gave a new
meaning to innovation .Steve Jobs was never a programmer. He was a product visionary, astute businessman,
and excellent if eccentric salesman. It was Steve Wozniak who built the Apple I while Steve promoted it.
As a designer, Steve Jobs has left a tremendous legacy. Thinking of Apple, we think of Steve Jobs and 
the innovative design he created, rather than specific hardware. An innovator and Marketing Genius. 

Some Fun Facts about SteveJobs:
 > He met Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak in high school when Wozniak was 18 and Jobs was 13 
 > When he was 13 years old, Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard).
